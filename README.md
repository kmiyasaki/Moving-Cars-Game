# Moving Cars Game

This is a program that opens an interactive graphical window that allows the user to play the Moving Cars game. The goal is to click on the moving cars to score points. The smaller the car clicked, the more points added to the total score at the bottom of the screen. Additionally, the number and color of each car clicked is recorded and displayed. The user can use buttons to pause and exit the game. 

This program was made using Python IDLE and can be run on any computer with Python 3.10 installed.
